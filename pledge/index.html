  <p>You are asked for your name and telephone number and the name of your current energy company (if you know it). This is so someone from Co-op Assist can call you and arrange your switch to a green energy company.</p>

  <p>Co-op Assist will keep these details secure and private and only share them with Good Energy.</p>
